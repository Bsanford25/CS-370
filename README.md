What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was the game setu code which was GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. It was my job to create code that included the reinforcement learning algorithm. I also wrote the loops that used Keras and Tensorflow to find the best path to the treasure.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientists solve problems and research solutions to problems using technology. It matters because in order for our world to keep moving forward and to keep progressing, we need to discover new and innovative ways to solve problems.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I use all of the resources I have available to me and look for other ones as well, to find the best possible solution to a problem. I look to see if there are any documented solutions first and if not, pull relevant data together and research for a solution.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are to always create safe and secure programs. When working with AI, try my best to limit biases and report biases that are noticed. Bias in AI can create many problems and it is important to recognize it and correct it.
